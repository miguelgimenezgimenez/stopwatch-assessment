# Description 

the project can be seen at http://stopwatch.miguelgimenez.tech/


I have done all the questions although only asked to do the first 2.

The first 2 questions are in the ***master*** branch , while the undo-redo with redux is in the ***feat-undo-redo*** branch.

I used a very simple Webpack (latest version) configuration.


**Install dependencies:**


    $ yarn 
    or 
    $ npm install


**Run project**


    $ npm run dev   
 
Browser should be opened or  go to ``http://localhost:8080/``
